Docker on CentOS (7.0 x64) on DigitalOcean using Ansible

Status
------
Pretty much done for now. It's an incredibly basic setup, but it does start and
setup Docker mostly correctly. Unfortunately the stuff I want to play with
doesn't play well with the version of Docker included in EPEL beta/7 (v1.0).

Also dealing with SELinux makes me unhappy.
